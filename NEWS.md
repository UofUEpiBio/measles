# measles 0.1.0

This is the first release of the measles R package, a spin-off of the epiworldR package, focused on modeling measles transmission dynamics.

## New Features

* Added `get_contact_matrix()` and `set_contact_matrix()` functions to retrieve and modify the contact matrix for mixing models. These functions are available for:
  - `ModelMeaslesMixing`
  - `ModelMeaslesMixingRiskQuarantine`

  Other mixing models in epiworld will have these methods available in the near future.
